## 🧩 **What is a Package?**

📦 A *package* is just a bundle of files needed to install a software.  
Linux keeps these in **repositories** (online storage of packages).  

You install software using your package manager — like `apt` in Ubuntu or `dnf` in Fedora.  
No shady downloads, no viruses 😎  

---

## ⚙️ **Task 1 — Update Your System**

Start by refreshing your package list:
```bash
sudo apt update
````

Then upgrade all installed apps:

```bash
sudo apt upgrade
```

💬 This keeps your system secure and up-to-date 🔐

---

## 💼 **Task 2 — Install a Software**

Let’s install VLC:

```bash
sudo apt install vlc
```

Now check if it’s installed:

```bash
vlc --version
```

🎉 Boom! You just installed software like a real sysadmin!

---

## 🧹 **Task 3 — Remove Software**

Don’t need it anymore? Remove it:

```bash
sudo apt remove vlc
```

Want to clean even the settings too?

```bash
sudo apt purge vlc
```

💡 **Tip:** Always clean up unused packages:

```bash
sudo apt autoremove
```

This frees up space 🧼

---

## 🔍 **Task 4 — Search for Tools**

Looking for a text editor?

```bash
apt search editor
```

Or maybe you want to find Python packages:

```bash
apt search python
```

🕵️ You’ll see a list of available tools — pick what you like!

---

## 📦 **Task 5 — Installing `.deb` Packages**

Sometimes, you’ll download a `.deb` file from the internet.
To install it manually:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i package-name.deb
```

If it shows errors, fix missing dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt -f install
```

And done ✅

---


## 🏁 **Summary**

Today you learned how to:
✅ Install new software with `apt`
✅ Update your system safely
✅ Remove apps and clean junk
✅ Search for packages
✅ Handle `.deb` files

You’re now a **Package Management Wizard 🧙‍♀️**

---

## 💡 **Challenge of the Day**

- Install the text editor **nano** using `apt`
- Then uninstall it
- Then finally clean your system with:

```bash
sudo apt autoremove

If you can do that — you’ve mastered software installation in Linux 🥳
